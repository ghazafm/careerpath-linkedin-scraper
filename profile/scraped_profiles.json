I'm Fauzan, an Informatics Engineering student at Brawijaya University with a passion for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Computer Networking. 🌐 My journey so far includes hands-on experience in processing big data, building ML models, and making sense of complex data.\n\nBeyond the classroom, I serve as a practicum assistant, guiding peers through their learning process. I've led numerous projects, such as developing a dynamic website for Richdjoe Barbershop using Laravel, which showcases my ability to translate technical skills into real-world solutions. Check out the live project [https://richdjoe.fauzanghaza.com].\n\n💡 With a knack for problem-solving and a curiosity for new technologies, I'm always eager to expand my analytical and programming skills. From designing efficient network topologies using GNS3 to conducting sentiment analysis on social media regarding the 2024 Indonesian election, I continually seek to apply scientific principles to innovate and improve.\n\nOpen to collaboration on exciting tech projects and internship opportunities, feel free to connect or explore my projects on GitHub [https://github.com/ghazafm]. Let's transform ideas into impactful solutions together! 🚀"
